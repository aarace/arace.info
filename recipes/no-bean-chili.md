# Instant Pot No-Bean Chili

## Notes
- This recipe can be made in a dutch oven or other large container, just simmer for a few hours rather than pressure cook
- A lot of the flavor comes from the meat fat content, don't use anything higher than 85% lean ground beef

## Chili Seasoning Ingredients
- 1/4 cup chili powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

### Directions
Mix all ingredients together thoroughly.

The above quantities make a little more than is required for one pot of chili. You can make the seasoning in larger batches to be used for future chili. Store in airtight container at room temperature.

- 2-3 serrano peppers, de-ribbed, de-seeded and diced
- 1 28oz can of ground peeled tomatoes
- 1 6oz can of tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Tobasco brand Chipotle hot sauce
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- salt to taste

### Prep
- prep the chili seasoning above
- dice onion, garlic, and peppers into separate prep bowls
  
### Directions
1. Sautee the ground beef and sausage with some black pepper in about a tablespoon of olive oil using the sautee setting (if using an Instant Pot), breaking up all the meat as it cooks.

2. Once cooked, remove to a bowl, retaining all oils and fats.

3. Add a litte more olive oil to the pan and add the onions.

4. Sautee the onions until they start to turn translucent, about 3 minutes

5. Add the minced garlic, stirring continuously, for about 1 minute, be careful not to let the garlic burn.

6. Add the chili seasoning. At this point, the seasoning will soak up all of the oil, and coat the onion and garlic. Stir continuously for about 1 minute. The seasoning will start to darken. As the seasoning toasts, be careful not to let any spots burn.

7. Add in the broth to deglaze everything. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the pot to mix everything together

8. Add the cooked meat and all other ingredients and stir well:

   - diced peppers
   - the cans of ground tomatoes and tomato paste
   - worcestershire sauce
   - tobasco sauce
   - apple cider vinegar
   - brown sugar

9. If using an Instant Pot, close the lid and use the Bean/Chili setting to  let it pressure cook for ~30 minutes. Otherwise, reduce the heat and  simmer for at least 2 hours (or longer), stirring ocassionally.

10. Use final taste test to determine if you should add a little more salt.
