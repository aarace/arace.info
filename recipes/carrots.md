## Required Special Equipment and Notes

- Source: Six Seasons

## Ingredients
### Brine
- 1/2 cup rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 1 1/2 cups tap hot water
- 5 tablespoonse sugar
- 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon kosher salt

### Seasonings
- 5 crushed garlic cloves
- 2 dried chilies

- 1 tablespoon toasted coriander seeds
  
## Prep
- If using slender springtime carrots (best), remove tops leaving 1/4" of greens. Scrub but don't peel
- If using full carrots, peel and cut into two-bite sticks

## Directions
- Stack the carrots standing up in the jar and tuck the seasonings in between

- Combine all other ingredients in a pot or pitcher and stir until sugar and salt have dissolved

- Pour brine over carrots until vegetables are completely covered and jar is full. Screw on the cap and refrigerate for up to 2 months.

- Start tasting after the first 24 hours to see how the falvor and texture are developing. They are ready to eat as soon as you think they are.
